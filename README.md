# NoWaste
NoWaste is a web app that allows people to easily identify products that can be recycled, locate recycling/donation centers nearest to them, find ways to donate the extra food they own to people who really need it.

NoWaste is an all in one recycling app for everyone to figure out how they can help reduce the overflowing landfills in our ecosystem and prevent the environment from getting destroyed.

## Inspiration
Overflowing Landfills: Let's take the example of a soda can. You might think, why do I need to recycle this small item and it's not like it's going to bring a huge difference to the environment. Well that's where the major issue is which we want to bring attention to. So, when recyclable items are tossed into garbage instead of recycling, they eventually end up in landfills. Now you may be like what's wrong about thatâ€¦ Well, these items take up valuable space that could otherwise be occupied by non recyclable materials. According to data from Waste Business Journal, American Landfills only have about 11 -16 years of capacity left. So once these landfills reach capacity, new areas will need to be repurposed to create new landfills, and most of the areas repurposed are generally rural areas bringing harm, when normally these areas could help sequester carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, thus affecting the environment.

Recycling and Reducing waste by donating extra food: While some people have the luxuries of throwing away reusable items, other communities lack resources. Recent estimates for global poverty are that 9.2% of the world, or 689 million people, live in extreme poverty on $1.90 or less a day, according to the World Bank. The other issue we are tackling is poverty. There are 775 million people in the world who are illiterate, with another 152 million children set to follow in their footsteps because they aren't attending school. With such large-scale problems like this, we need to provide resources and the great thing is we already have them, one might even say an excess of them.

## What's next for NoWaste
In the future:

- We hope to expand our database so that our camera can recognize more products and objects and allow the users to have a better experience with our project
- We hope to make our UI better and add some animations to it
- We hope to make our carbon footprint quiz more detailed
